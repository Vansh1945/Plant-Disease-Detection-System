# Plant-Disease-Detection-System

This project is a plant disease detection system that analyzes plant leaf images and provides disease classification along with step-by-step home remedies. It is built using Streamlit, Python, and OpenCV and does not require a trained ML model. Instead, it uses image processing techniques (color & brightness analysis) to classify leaves as Blight, Rust, or Healthy.

⚡ Features:
✅ User-friendly web app using Streamlit
✅ Plant leaf validation (checks if the uploaded image is a valid leaf)
✅ Disease detection based on image brightness and color properties
✅ Home remedies for each disease
✅ Downloadable report in Word format


▶️ Run the Application
   streamlit run app.py
